# AVALON

## Introduction

This project is browser-based clone of the board game Avalon. It is built using React, Python, CSS, Flask, SQLAlchemy and Socket.io. It was built as my capstone project at the Flatiron Software Engineering bootcamp. 

Users can create games and join the games of others. There is an in game chat feature or the players can play using their favorite voice chat app.

## Running the game

To run the server run pipenv install && pipenv shell. The server is set up to automatically run on localhost:5555. The client can be run with npm run dev and will automatically run on localhost:3000. If you want to run multiple clients on one machine you can just do it in seperate browser windows.
